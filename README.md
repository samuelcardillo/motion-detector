# motion-detector

![Camera Element](http://samuelcardillo.com/motion-detector/md.gif)

I initially did this project in order to turn on the lights of my kitchen when I enter it and then... It ended up here.

## How does it work ?
Enabling motion detection on video stream with possibility to add detection areas.

More informations on the [element documentation](https://samuelcardillo.com/motion-detector/).

Example:

    <motion-detector>
      <video autoplay class="source"></video>
    </motion-detector>

## What's next ?

* Multiple movements box
* More performant processing ?
* Labelling (for smart following)
* Your push ! :D 

## Special thanks
Special thanks to [doodloo](https://github.com/hickscorp) for his precious help on improving the performances.
